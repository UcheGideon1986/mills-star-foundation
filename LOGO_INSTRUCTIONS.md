# How to Add Your Logo

## Quick Steps:

1. **Save your logo image** as one of these formats:
   - `logo.png` (recommended)
   - `logo.jpg`
   - `logo.svg`

2. **Place the file** in the `public` folder:
   ```
   /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project-2/public/logo.png
   ```

3. **The website will automatically use it!**

## Current Setup:

The website is already configured to use `/logo.svg` or `/logo.png` in:
- ✅ Navigation bar (top)
- ✅ Footer (bottom)
- ✅ Admin login page

## To Replace the Logo:

### Option 1: Using Finder (Easiest)
1. Open Finder
2. Navigate to: `/Users/mac/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project-2/public/`
3. Drag and drop your logo file there
4. Rename it to `logo.png` or `logo.svg`
5. Refresh your browser - done!

### Option 2: Using Terminal
```bash
cd /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project-2/public
# Then copy your logo file here and rename it
cp ~/Downloads/your-logo.png ./logo.png
```

### Option 3: I can help you

- **Recommended size**: 512x512 pixels or larger

- Scale it appropriately for each location
