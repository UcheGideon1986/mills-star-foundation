# 🎨 Logo Update Instructions

## ✅ Logo Updated!

I've updated the logo SVG file, but to use your exact uploaded logo image, follow these steps:

---

## 📥 **How to Add Your Uploaded Logo**

### Option 1: Save as PNG (Recommended)

1. **Save your uploaded logo image as:**
   ```
   /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project-2/public/logo.png
   ```

2. **Update Navigation.tsx and Footer.tsx to use PNG:**
   - Change: `src="/logo.svg"`
   - To: `src="/logo.png"`

### Option 2: Keep SVG (Current)

The logo is already updated with an improved SVG version that matches your design:
- ✅ Two figures (wheelchair user and standing person)
- ✅ Green and blue colors
- ✅ Dynamic, inclusive design
- ✅ Represents support and empowerment

## 📁 **Files That Use the Logo**

### 1. Navigation.tsx (Line 37)
```tsx
<img 
  src="/logo.svg"  // Change to /logo.png if using PNG
  alt="Mills Star Foundation Logo" 
  className="h-12 w-12"
/>
```

### 2. Footer.tsx (Line 25)
```tsx
<img 
  src="/logo.svg"  // Change to /logo.png if using PNG
  alt="Mills Star Foundation Logo" 
  className="h-10 w-10"
/>
```

---

## 🎯 **To Use Your Exact Uploaded Logo**

### Step 1: Save the Image
1. Right-click your uploaded logo image
2. Save as: `logo.png`
3. Move to: `/Users/mac/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project-2/public/`

### Step 2: Update References (Optional)
If you want to use PNG instead of SVG:

**Navigation.tsx:**
```tsx
<img 
  src="/logo.png"
  alt="Mills Star Foundation Logo" 
  className="h-12 w-12 object-contain"
/>
```

**Footer.tsx:**
```tsx
<img 
  src="/logo.png"
  alt="Mills Star Foundation Logo" 
  className="h-10 w-10 object-contain"
/>
```
