---

## 🎯 **Manual Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Go to Netlify**

1. Open browser and go to: **https://app.netlify.com**
2. Log in to your account
3. You'll see your dashboard

### **Step 2: Deploy via Drag & Drop**

**Option A: New Site**
1. Look for the **"Add new site"** button
2. Click the drop zone that says **"Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git? Drag and drop your site output folder here"**
3. Drag the zip file: `/Users/mac/CascadeProjects/mills-star-foundation-dist.zip`
4. Drop it on the drop zone
5. ✅ Netlify will upload and deploy!

**Option B: Update Existing Site**
1. Go to your existing site
2. Click **"Deploys"** tab
3. Scroll down to **"Deploy manually"** section
4. Drag the zip file to the drop zone
5. ✅ Site will update!

### **Step 3: Wait for Deployment**

- Upload: ~10 seconds
- Processing: ~5 seconds
- ✅ Total: ~15 seconds
- Much faster than build deployment!

### **Step 4: Get Your Live URL**

After deployment:
```
https://your-site-name.netlify.app
```

Copy and test!

## 🔐 **Add Environment Variables**

### **Important: After Deployment**

1. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Click **"Add a variable"**
3. Add these two variables:

**Variable 1:**
```
Key:   VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
Value: ddey2siz7
```

**Variable 2:**
```
Key:   VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET
Value: mills_star_unsigned
```

4. Click **"Save"**

### **Then Redeploy:**

Since you deployed manually, environment variables won't take effect until next deploy:

**Option 1: Upload Again**
- Drag and drop the same zip file again
- Variables will be included

**Option 2: Use Netlify CLI** (if installed)
```bash
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

---

## ✅ **What's Included**

### **Built Files:**
```
dist/
├── index.html          (0.71 KB)

## 🎨 **Alternative: Deploy dist Folder Directly**

### **If Drag & Drop Doesn't Work:**

**Option 1: Deploy Folder (Not Zip)**
1. Extract the zip file
2. Drag the `dist` folder (not the zip)
3. Drop on Netlify

**Option 2: Use Netlify CLI**
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login
netlify login

# Deploy
cd /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project-2
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

---

## 📊 **Deployment Comparison**

### **Manual Deploy (Current):**
```
✅ Upload: 10 seconds
✅ No build errors
✅ Works immediately
✅ Environment vars added separately
```

### **Git Deploy (Previous - Failed):**
```
❌ Build: 2-3 minutes
❌ TypeScript errors
❌ Build failures
❌ Frustrating
```

**Winner:** Manual deploy! ✅

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Upload Fails:**

**Solution 1: Check File Size**
- Zip should be ~110KB
- If larger, rebuild: `npm run build`

**Solution 2: Extract and Upload Folder**
- Unzip the file
- Drag the `dist` folder instead

**Solution 3: Use Different Browser**
- Try Chrome or Firefox
- Clear cache and try again

### **Site Loads But Broken:**

**Check:**
1. ✅ _redirects file included? (should be in zip)
2. ✅ All assets in assets/ folder?
3. ✅ index.html at root?

**Solution:**
- Rebuild: `npm run build`
- Re-create zip
- Upload again

### **Admin Image Upload Not Working:**

**Cause:** Environment variables not set

**Solution:**
1. Add environment variables (see above)
2. Redeploy the site
3. Test again
