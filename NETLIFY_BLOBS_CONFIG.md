# 🔧 Netlify Blobs Configuration Guide

## ✅ **Good News: Netlify Blobs is Already Enabled!**

Netlify Blobs is **automatically available** on all Netlify sites. No manual activation needed!

---

## 🚀 **What I've Done**

### **1. Updated Netlify Functions**
- ✅ Fixed `get-images.ts` to use proper Context API
- ✅ Fixed `save-images.ts` to use proper Context API
- ✅ Added CORS handling
- ✅ Added better error messages
- ✅ Installed `@netlify/functions` package

### **2. Functions Now Use:**
```typescript
const store = getStore({
  name: 'images',
  consistency: 'strong',
  siteID: context.site.id,  // Auto-provided by Netlify
  token: context.token,      // Auto-provided by Netlify
});
```

---

## ✅ **How to Enable (It's Automatic!)**

### **Step 1: Push Code to GitHub**

```bash
cd /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project-2
git add .
git commit -m "Configure Netlify Blobs with proper Context API"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Wait for Netlify to Deploy**

- Netlify automatically deploys when you push
- Takes ~2-3 minutes
- Functions are automatically deployed
- Blobs are automatically available!

### **Step 3: Test It!**

1. Go to your admin panel
2. Upload some images
3. Click "Sync to Cloud" (in the Advanced section)
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Try "Load from Cloud"
6. ✅ Should work!

Click "Sync to Cloud"
    ↓
POST to /.netlify/functions/save-images
    ↓
Netlify Function runs
    ↓
Saves to Netlify Blobs (cloud storage)
    ↓
✅ Data stored in cloud

Other Device
    ↓

## 📊 **What Gets Stored in Blobs**

### **Blob Keys:**
- `gallery-images` - All gallery images
- `site-images` - 12 site location images
- `impact-images` - 6 impact section images
- `blog-posts` - All blog posts

### **Data Format:**
```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "id": "img-123",
      "url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
      "alt": "Image title",
      "uploadedAt": "2025-01-26T10:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "siteImages": {
    "hero": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
    "about": "https://res.cloudinary.com/..."
  },
  "impactImages": [...],
  "blogPosts": [...]
}
```

## 🔍 **Verify It's Working**

### **Method 1: Check Netlify Dashboard**

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your site
3. Go to: **Functions** tab
4. You should see:
   - `get-images`
   - `save-images`
5. Click on a function to see logs

### **Method 2: Check Browser Console**

1. Open admin panel
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Click "Sync to Cloud"
5. Watch for:
   - ✅ Success messages
   - ❌ Error messages

### **Method 3: Test the API Directly**

```bash
# Test GET (should return empty data initially)
curl https://your-site-name.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/get-images

# Should return:
# {"images":[],"siteImages":{},"impactImages":[],"blogPosts":[]}
```

## ⚠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Error: "Failed to fetch images"**

**Possible Causes:**
1. Functions not deployed yet
2. Network issue
3. Blobs not initialized

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for deployment to finish
2. Check Netlify function logs
3. Try again in a few minutes

### **Error: "Failed to save images"**

**Possible Causes:**
1. CORS issue
2. Invalid data format
3. Network timeout

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for details
2. Verify data format is correct
3. Try with smaller data set

### **Functions Not Showing in Netlify**

**Solution:**
1. Check `netlify.toml` has correct build command
2. Verify functions are in `netlify/functions/` folder
3. Check deployment logs for errors
4. Redeploy if needed
