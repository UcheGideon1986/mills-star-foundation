## 📱 **How to Make Images Show on All Devices**

### **Step 1: Upload Images in Admin**

1. Go to: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/admin`
2. Login with: `admin123`

4. Images are saved locally on your device

### **Step 2: Download JSON File**

1. Look for the **green "Simple Export/Import"** card at the top
2. Click **"Download JSON"** button
3. A file called `images.json` will download to your computer
4. ✅ This file contains all your image data!

### **Step 3: Replace the JSON File**

1. Open your project folder: `/Users/mac/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project-2`
2. Navigate to: `public/data/images.json`
3. **Replace** that file with the one you just downloaded
4. The new file has all your uploaded images!

### **Step 4: Push to GitHub**

```bash
cd /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project-2
git add public/data/images.json
git commit -m "Update images data"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 5: Done! ✅**

- Netlify auto-deploys (takes ~2 minutes)

- File is deployed with your site
- All devices fetch from the same JSON file
- ✅ Everyone sees the same images!

## 📂 **File Structure**

```
windsurf-project-2/
├── public/

│   ├── Gallery.tsx      ← Reads from images.json
│   └── Home.tsx         ← Reads from images.json
```
