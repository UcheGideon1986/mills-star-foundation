## üöÄ How to Upload Images Successfully

### For Gallery Images:

1. **Compress Your Images First** (Recommended)
   - Use [TinyPNG.com](https://tinypng.com) - Free, easy to use
   - Use [Squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app) - Advanced options
   - Use [Compressor.io](https://compressor.io) - Fast compression
   - Target: Under 500KB per image for best results

2. **Upload Process**
   ```
   ‚úì Enter image title
   ‚úì Select category
   ‚úì Choose image file(s)
   ‚úì Preview images
   ‚úì Click "Upload"
   ‚úì Wait for success message
   ```

3. **Best Practices**
   - Upload 1-5 images at a time (not 20+ at once)
   - Compress images before uploading
   - Delete old images if storage is full
   - Use JPG format for photos (smaller than PNG)

### For Site Images:

1. **Compress the Image**
   - Site images should be under 1MB
   - Hero images: 1920x1080px, compressed to ~300-500KB
   - Section images: 1080x1080px, compressed to ~200-400KB

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Storage quota exceeded" Error

**Cause**: localStorage has a limit of ~5-10MB total

**Solutions**:
1. **Compress images more** - Aim for 200-500KB per image
2. **Delete old images** - Go to "Manage Images" tab and delete unused images
3. **Upload fewer images** - Upload 1-3 images at a time instead of bulk
4. **Clear browser cache** - Sometimes helps free up space

### Issue 2: White Screen After Clicking Upload

**Cause**: This was caused by synchronous file reading blocking the UI

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Now uses async/await

**If it still happens**:
1. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Try a different browser
4. Clear browser cache and cookies

### Issue 3: Upload Button Does Nothing

**Possible Causes**:
- No image title entered
- No file selected
- File too large (>10MB)
- Reached 100 image limit

**Solutions**:
1. Check that you entered an image title
2. Make sure you selected a file
3. Check file size (should be under 10MB)
4. Check capacity indicator (should be under 100 images)

### Issue 4: "Failed to read file" Error

**Cause**: File format not supported or file corrupted

**Solutions**:
1. Use only PNG, JPG, or GIF formats
2. Try re-saving the image in a different program
3. Try a different image file
4. Check if file is corrupted

## üìä Storage Limits Explained

### localStorage Limits:
- **Total Storage**: ~5-10MB (varies by browser)
- **Per Image**: Recommended under 500KB
- **Maximum Images**: 100 gallery + 12 site images

### Why Compression Matters:

**Without Compression:**
- 5MB image ‚Üí ~6.7MB in base64 ‚Üí Can only store 1-2 images!

**With Compression:**
- 500KB image ‚Üí ~670KB in base64 ‚Üí Can store 100+ images!

**Base64 Overhead:**
- Base64 encoding increases file size by ~33%
- A 1MB image becomes ~1.33MB in storage
- This is why compression is crucial!
